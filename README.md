## Introduction
We usually need to know the weather forecast in our zone, in order to plan the activities we'll do. For example, playing football or go out running if it's going to rain. However, we don't really need to know the weather forecast. We don't care if it's going to be a completely sunny day or if there will be a few clouds in the sky; what we want is to know if it will rain, snow, or any similar condition that will make us change our usual plans. 

That's why I've invented [@BadWeatherBot](https://t.me/badweatherbot): a Telegram bot that will tell you, with a single command, if you need to worry or not about the weather in your zone during the following days.

## How to use
The usage is incredibly simple: first of all, you send it your location so it can know to what place has to ask the weather for. It will reply you with a confirmation message in order to indicate you that the location has been correctly obtained.

The next step is to use the corresponding command to get the weather updates. You have two commands available, depending on which situation you are
 - You are about to head up to school or work and need to know if you'll need to get an umbrella? Then just use the **/umbrella** command and @BadWeatherBot will answer you **if it will rain on the next 24 hours or not.**
- You need to wash your clothes, but you don't want rain to soak them when they're drying outside? The **/washingmachine** command is for you!  It will indicate you **if it will rain within 3 days**

And that's it! Simple but effective, as you can see in the following pictures
