## Introduction
We usually need to know the weather forecast in our zone, in order to plan the activities we'll do. For example, playing football or go out running if it's going to rain. However, we don't really need to know the weather forecast. We don't care if it's going to be a completely sunny day or if there will be a few clouds in the sky; what we want is to know if it will rain, snow, or any similar condition that will make us change our usual plans. 

That's why I've invented [@MalTiempoBot](https://t.me/maltiempobot): a Telegram bot that will tell you, with a single command, if you need to worry or not about the weather in your zone during the following days.
